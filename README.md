# DistributedProject

## project : Create an encyclopedia of random data of 300 words ( either create it in a text file and import the data in the program later or create it in the program itself ) and then find out from these data the followings :
* 1- The number of letters in these 300 words (spaces included as well).
* 2- The Repeated words in these 300 words.
* 3- The longest word in these 300 words.
* 4- The shortest word in these 300 words.
* 5- The repetition number of each word in these 300 words.

First write a non-threaded version and see how long it takes in time to Extract these data and then write it again but this time with a muilti-threaded version and calculate the speed up ( in milliseconds ) it took from the non-threaded one.
Use the following functions with these exact names :
1- Count : for the number of letters.
2- repeatedwords : for the words repeated.
3- longest: for the longest word.
4- shortest: for the shortest word.
5- Repeat: for the number of times each word appeared.

These methods will be implemented using Rmi (Remote method invocation) but in the local machine.

Bonus : include in the project a GUI ( Graphical user interface ) using any method you desire.

Teams allowed but not more than 5 Students.
you can choose anyone from any group as long as he is registered in the distributed data analysis course
